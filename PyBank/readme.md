This is a read me for the folder PyBank.
The folder includes three files:
1) 03-Python_homework_PyBank_Resources_budget_data - The csv data file
2) main.py - The python code that reads and does some basic analysis on the csv data file
3) PyBank_result.txt - The text file that includes the result of the python code
